# **Moving Matters Mobile App**

The **Moving Matters Initiative (MM)**, founded by **Dr. Victoria Venable-Edwards** in 2023, is dedicated to promoting movement to boost wellbeing. In collaboration with Dr. Venable-Edwards, I, **Connor Sullivan**, developed the first cross-platform Moving Matters mobile app using **Flutter** and **Firebase**. This app engages participants, shares event information, and fosters a sense of community through fitness challenges and social networking features.

## Overview

The Moving Matters mobile app was developed as part of a summer project at **Salisbury University**, where I led the development process. This app demonstrates my proficiency in app development, from feature design to secure user authentication, using modern mobile frameworks such as, Flutter for the frontend, and Firebase for the Backend. It also showcases my ability to collaborate on real-world projects, deliver a fully-functional product, and meet user needs.

## Features

- **Workout Program Creation**: Users can create and customize workout programs based on their fitness goals and preferences.
