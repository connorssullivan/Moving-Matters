Moving Matters Mobile App
The Moving Matters Initiative (MM), founded by Dr. Victoria Venable-Edwards in 2023, is dedicated to promoting movement as a way to boost wellbeing. In collaboration with Dr. Venable-Edwards, I, Connor Sullivan, developed the first cross-platform Moving Matters mobile app using Flutter and Firebase. The app engages participants, shares event information, and fosters a sense of community through fitness challenges and social networking features.

Overview
The Moving Matters mobile app was developed as part of a summer project at Salisbury University, and I led the development process. This app demonstrates my proficiency in app development, from feature design to secure user authentication, using modern mobile frameworks. It also showcases my ability to collaborate on real-world projects, deliver a fully-functional product, and meet user needs.

Features
Workout Program Creation: Users can create and customize workout programs based on their fitness goals and preferences.

Social Networking: Similar to platforms like Instagram and Twitter, the app allows users to share workouts, follow friends, and interact through posts and comments.

Program Sharing: Users can share their custom workout programs with the community, enabling a collaborative and motivating environment.

Workout Stat Tracking: Users can track their progress with detailed workout statistics, including the ability to visualize performance through easy-to-use interfaces.

Monthly Group Challenges: The app hosts group challenges where users can compete, track their progress, and have the chance to win prizes.

Secure Sign-In and Email Authentication: Secure user authentication with email sign-in, utilizing Firebase for robust backend support.

Technologies Used
Flutter: A cross-platform mobile framework that enabled the development of a responsive app for both iOS and Android devices.

Firebase: The app leverages Firebase for backend services such as authentication, real-time databases, and data storage.

My Role
As the lead developer, I was responsible for:

Architecting the app's core features, including program creation and stat tracking.
Integrating Firebase to provide real-time data syncing and user authentication.
Designing and implementing social networking functionality.
Coordinating with faculty mentors to ensure the app met the initiative's goals.
