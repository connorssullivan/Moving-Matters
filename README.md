# **Moving Matters Mobile App**

The **Moving Matters Initiative (MM)**, founded by **Dr. Victoria Venable-Edwards** in 2023, is dedicated to promoting movement to boost wellbeing. In collaboration with Dr. Venable-Edwards, I, **Connor Sullivan**, developed the first cross-platform Moving Matters mobile app using **Flutter** and **Firebase**. This app engages participants, shares event information, and fosters a sense of community through fitness challenges and social networking features.

## Overview

The Moving Matters mobile app was developed as part of a summer project at **Salisbury University**, where I led the development process. This app demonstrates my proficiency in app development, from feature design to secure user authentication, using modern mobile frameworks such as, Flutter for the frontend, and Firebase for the Backend. It also showcases my ability to collaborate on real-world projects, deliver a fully-functional product, and meet user needs.

## Features

- **Workout Program Creation**: Users can create and customize workout programs based on their fitness goals and preferences.

- **Social Networking**: Similar to platforms like Instagram and Twitter, the app allows users to share workouts, follow friends, and interact through posts and comments.
  
- **Program Sharing**: Users can share their custom workout programs with the community, creating a collaborative and motivating environment.
  
- **Workout Stat Tracking**: Users can track their progress with detailed workout statistics, including easy-to-use interfaces to visualize performance.

- **Monthly Group Challenges**: The app hosts group challenges where users can compete, track progress, and win prizes.

- **Secure Sign-In and Email Authentication**: Secure user authentication with email sign-in, powered by Firebase for backend support.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A cross-platform mobile framework that enables responsive app development for both iOS and Android devices.
  
- **Firebase**: The app leverages Firebase for backend services, including authentication, real-time databases, and data storage.

## My Role

As the lead developer, I was responsible for:

- Architecting the appâ€™s core features, including workout program creation and stat tracking.
- Integrating Firebase to provide real-time data syncing and user authentication.
- Designing and implementing social networking functionality.
- Coordinating with faculty mentors to ensure the app met the initiative's goals.
